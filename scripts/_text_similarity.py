"""Shared title-similarity + retry-budget helpers for the v3.9.0 cross-index
triangulation clients.

Previously triple-implemented byte-equivalently in
`semantic_scholar_client.py`, `openalex_client.py`, and `crossref_client.py`.
Extracted in #128 (v3.9.1 housekeeping) to prevent sibling drift — any
threshold tuning or normalization rule change now happens in one place.

`_normalize_title` / `_similarity` stay byte-equivalent with the v3.7.3 /
v3.9.0 client implementations for every NON-dotted-acronym title; #431 §0.1
adds a dotted-acronym pre-pass that can only *raise* `_similarity` (taken via
`max`), plus the `exact_normalized_title` / `generic_title` identity helpers the
exact-title-or-bust gate (§0.12) reads. See `test_text_similarity.py` for the
similarity contract and `test_431_exact_or_bust.py` for the gate behavior.
